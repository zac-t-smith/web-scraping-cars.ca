# web-scraping-cars.ca
I'm unsure if cars.ca changes their html frequently like Airbnb, but note if you run this and do not receive the data into your data frame, that is probably why. 

This code pulls the Name, Price, Color, and Link of all the listings in your cars.ca search. Please note, it is not limited to the first page and will pull each listing
